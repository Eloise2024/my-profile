				<h2><strong>Ballet!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Ballet is my escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. I started dancing when I was 4 years old and never stopped since then. But to me, growing up in a dance studio taught me more than technique and artistic, it implemented core value in me like resilience.Whether Iâ€™m at the barre or center stage, ballet allows me to channel my emotions and creativity into every step.

				<h2><strong>Running!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Running is my ultimate freedom. It allows me take a break from the stress of life and stay in shape. The rhythmic pounding of my feet against the pavement clears my mind and invigorates my spirit. Whether Iâ€™m sprinting through the park or tackling a challenging trail, the sense of accomplishment and adrenaline rush I feel with each mile conquered is unmatched.

				<h2><strong>Cooking & Baking!</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Cooking and baking are my creative outlets in the kitchen. From experimenting with new flavors to perfecting classic recipes, I find joy in the process of creating delicious dishes from scratch. In my culture, meal time is sacred, it is about sharing and savouring. That is the reason one why cooking for the people I love, whether it is show affection or to spend quality time, matters to me.
